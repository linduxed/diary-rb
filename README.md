# Personal diary script

This is a small script I've thrown together to emulate the functionality of the site [Trailmix](https://www.trailmix.life/).

I haven't used the site, but I liked the idea.
The only part I didn't like was handing my diary over to a third party.

I'm currently throwing around various ideas with the script, which is why there hasn't been any effort to refactor the thing, so far.
